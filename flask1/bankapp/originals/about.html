<h1>Our Goal</h1>
<p>Bank of America is comprised of many businesses which in turn, are comprised of many applications, services, and processes. 
  Those applications, services, and many other sub-branches underneath the business may have dependencies between them. The purpose
  of this project is to visualize these dependencies in a clear and consise platform as well as map the impact these connections
  have on one another. Each tab is a way to visualize the current status of a business.</p>
